**Exercise 4.5 Determine the outcome.**
- -30*3+21/5= -86
- -30+3*21/5=-18
- 30/3*21%5= 0
- -30/3*21%4=-2

**Exercise 4.17 Describe the difference between prefix and postfix increment**  

	Prefix increments the operand and returns the changed version. Postfix increment returns the operand unchanged and then increments it.

**Exercise 4.34 Explain the conversion taking place**
- ```if (fval) ``` In conditions non-boolean expressions are converted to boolean.
- ```dval=fval+ival; ``` ival is converted to floating type, the sum is converted to a double.
- ```dval+ival*cval;``` cval is promoted to an integer and the product is converted to a double.
